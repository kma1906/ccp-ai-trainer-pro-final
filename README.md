# CCP AI Trainer PRO (Local, VS Code, ZIP)

**Stack:** React + Vite, localStorage, Web Speech API (Edge), optional OpenAI API for smarter tutor replies.

## Quick Start
1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Open folder in VS Code.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the shown local URL (usually http://localhost:5173). Use **Microsoft Edge** for best voice support.

## Settings
- Go to **Settings** page to paste your OpenAI API Key (optional). Without it, tutor uses a simple local mode.
- Choose default language (English/ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©).

## Personal Tutor (Human-like)
- Click **Speak üéôÔ∏è** to talk. Uses Web Speech API (Edge).
- Two voices:
  - **Dr Khaled** (male)
  - **Dr Noof** (female)
- The app auto-picks the closest available Edge voice. You can switch voices anytime.

## Exams
- **Mock Exam:** up to 50 Q (sampling from your bank).
- **Final Exam:** targets **119** Q + one **Memo** text answer.
- Results are saved to localStorage and reflected on the Dashboard (avg score + weak areas).

## Questions Bank
- Comes with small English/Arabic seed. Add your full bank via **Questions (Admin)** page:
  - Paste CSV with columns: `id,q,a1,a2,a3,a4,c,cat`
  - Choose language and Import.
- Imported sets are stored in localStorage keys: `qs_en` / `qs_ar`.

## Analytics
- Dashboard shows weak areas bar chart and an auto study plan.

## Notes
- No server or database needed now (safe for work). Data is local to the browser.
- To reset, clear site data from browser (localStorage).

## Using a `.env` file (optional but recommended for local dev)
Create a file named `.env` in the project root:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
Then rebuild:
```
npm run build
npm run preview
```
or just `npm run dev` again.

## Troubleshooting API Key
- Test your key from **Settings ‚Üí Test Key**.
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or line breaks.
- Use **Microsoft Edge** and run from **http://localhost:5173** (CORS is allowed by OpenAI).
- If you still see errors, try rebuilding after adding `.env`, or share the test message.

## Vercel-ready deployment (placeholder API key included)
This package is prepared for **Vercel**. It includes a placeholder API key embedded in the code:
```
sk-yourkey-placeholder
```
**IMPORTANT:** Replace the placeholder with your real OpenAI key **before** deploying to Vercel.

### To replace the placeholder locally (recommended)
1. Open `src/lib/openai.js` and find the line that returns the API key. Replace `'sk-yourkey-placeholder'` with your real key (keep the quotes).  
   Or, in Settings page in the app paste the key and Save after deployment (less recommended for demo).

### To deploy on Vercel (quick):
1. Create a Vercel account and install Vercel CLI if you want, or use the web dashboard.  
2. Push this project to a GitHub repo or upload the ZIP via Vercel web UI.  
3. If you prefer not to embed the key in code for production, add it in Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables (key: `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`).

### Notes on security
- Embedding API keys in code is convenient for demos, but **not secure** for public repos. Replace the placeholder with a real key and consider using Vercel Environment Variables for production.
